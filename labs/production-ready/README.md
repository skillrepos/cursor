## Part 1: Security Audit with Custom Hook (2 min)

### Step 1: Create Security Hook

Create `.cursor/hooks/security-audit.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Security Audit Hook
 * Runs before major changes to catch security issues
 */
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  name: 'Security Auditor',

  async onBeforeComposer(context) {
    const securityIssues = [];

    // Check for common vulnerabilities
    const patterns = {
      'Hardcoded Secret': /(['"])(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\\1\\s*[:=]\\s*['"][^'"]{8,}/gi,
      'SQL Injection': /query\\s*\\([^?]*\\+/gi,
      'Eval Usage': /eval\\s*\\(/gi,
      'Unsafe Regex': /new\\s+RegExp\\([^,]*\\+/gi
    };

    for (const [issue, pattern] of Object.entries(patterns)) {
      if (pattern.test(context.prompt)) {
        securityIssues.push({
          severity: 'high',
          type: issue,
          message: `Potential ${issue} detected in prompt`
        });
      }
    }

    if (securityIssues.length > 0) {
      return {
        allow: false,
        message: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Security Issues Detected:\n\n${
          securityIssues.map(i => `- ${i.type}: ${i.message}`).join('\n')
        }\n\nPlease address these issues first.`
      };
    }

    return { allow: true };
  },

  async onAfterGeneration(context) {
    // Run automated security scan
    console.log('‚úì Security audit passed');
    return { success: true };
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Test the Hook

Try to use Composer with a vulnerable pattern:
```
Composer: Add user authentication with password = 'admin123'
```

Hook should block this and suggest using environment variables.

**üìù Key Learning:** Hooks act as automated quality gates, preventing security issues before they're committed.

## Part 2: Comprehensive Testing with Background Agent (3 min)

### Step 1: Start Background Agent for Testing

```
Open new Chat tab (Cmd+Shift+L)

Background Agent Task: Generate Complete Test Suite

@Folder before/ - Analyze all files

Create comprehensive tests:

1. UNIT TESTS (services/, models/)
   - Test all functions
   - Mock dependencies
   - Cover edge cases
   - Test error handling

2. INTEGRATION TESTS (routes/)
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Test authentication flows
   - Test database operations
   - Test WebSocket connections

3. E2E TESTS (with Playwright)
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Test checkout process
   - Test real-time notifications
   - Test error scenarios

4. PERFORMANCE TESTS
   - Load testing with k6
   - Stress testing critical endpoints
   - Memory leak detection

5. SECURITY TESTS
   - SQL injection attempts
   - XSS attempts
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting

SETUP:
- Configure Jest
- Set up test database
- Add coverage reporting
- Create test helpers
- Mock external services

TARGET: 80%+ code coverage

Run as background agent.
```

While tests generate, continue with other tasks.

**üìù Key Learning:** Background Agents handle time-consuming test generation while you work on other production concerns.

## Part 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Composer (2 min)

### Step 1: Use Composer for CI/CD

```
Open Composer (Cmd+I)
Enable Plan Mode

Prompt:
Create complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

WORKFLOWS NEEDED:

1. .github/workflows/test.yml
   - Run on every PR
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linter (ESLint)
   - Run tests with coverage
   - Upload coverage to Codecov
   - Check coverage threshold (80%)
   - Security scan with npm audit

2. .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
   - Run on merge to develop
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to container registry
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Notify team on Slack

3. .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
   - Run on release tag
   - Require manual approval
   - Build production Docker image
   - Run security scan
   - Deploy to production
   - Run health checks
   - Rollback on failure
   - Notify team

4. .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
   - Run weekly
   - Dependency vulnerability scan
   - SAST analysis
   - Container image scan
   - Report findings

ALSO CREATE:
- Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
- docker-compose.yml (for local dev)
- .dockerignore
- Health check endpoints
- Deployment scripts

Follow best practices for:
- Secrets management
- Environment variables
- Caching strategies
- Parallel execution
```

### Step 2: Review Composer's Plan

Composer shows:
```
Phase 1: CI Configuration
  ‚úì .github/workflows/test.yml
  ‚úì .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
  ‚úì .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
  ‚úì .github/workflows/security-scan.yml

Phase 2: Containerization
  ‚úì Dockerfile
  ‚úì docker-compose.yml
  ‚úì .dockerignore

Phase 3: Deployment Scripts
  ‚úì scripts/deploy.sh
  ‚úì scripts/rollback.sh
  ‚úì scripts/health-check.sh

[Execute Plan]
```

**üìù Key Learning:** Composer handles complex multi-file CI/CD setup, ensuring all pieces work together.

## Part 4: Monitoring & Logging with AGENTS.md Workflow (2 min)

### Step 1: Add to AGENTS.md

```markdown
### Workflow: Add Production Monitoring

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging

**Steps:**
1. Set up Winston for structured logging
2. Add request/response logging middleware
3. Integrate error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
4. Add performance monitoring (New Relic/Datadog)
5. Create custom metrics
6. Set up health check endpoint
7. Add database query logging
8. Implement log rotation
9. Create monitoring dashboard config
10. Set up alerts

**Files to Create:**
- utils/logger.js
- middleware/requestLogger.js
- config/monitoring.js
- config/sentry.js
- monitoring/metrics.js
- health/checks.js

**Integration Points:**
- Add to app.js
- Wrap all routes
- Catch all errors
- Log all database queries
```

### Step 2: Use Chat with AGENTS.md

```
Chat: @File AGENTS.md - Implement production monitoring workflow

Follow the monitoring workflow to add:
- Structured logging with Winston
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring
- Custom business metrics
- Health checks
- Alerting rules

Reference the production-ready patterns from .cursorrules
```

Chat + AGENTS.md will guide through complete implementation.

**üìù Key Learning:** AGENTS.md workflows ensure nothing is missed in complex production setup.

---

## Part 5: API Documentation (1 min)

### Step 1: Generate Swagger Docs

```
Cmd+K on app.js

Prompt:
Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation:
- Install swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express
- Create /api-docs endpoint
- Document all routes with JSDoc annotations
- Include request/response examples
- Add authentication details
- Generate interactive docs
```

### Step 2: Auto-Document All Routes

```
Composer: Add OpenAPI documentation to all route files

For each route in:
- routes/auth.js
- routes/products.js
- routes/cart.js
- routes/orders.js
- routes/notifications.js

Add JSDoc comments with:
- Description
- Parameters
- Request body schema
- Response schema
- Status codes
- Example requests/responses
```

**üìù Key Learning:** Auto-generate API docs to save hours of manual documentation.
